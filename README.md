# Invoice Generator

This project was completed as one of multiple challenges in the Front-End Developer Career Path at [Skrimba](https://scrimba.com/about). The final MVP, while not practical for actual business use in its current form, demonstrates important principles and skills. I created the entire project from scratch from a provided [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/roUn8DT7zHTI9tcL2JXNZG/Invoice-Generator?node-id=0%3A1) (_or see Figma.pdf above_).

The live application can be **[found here](https://redirwin.github.io/invoice-creator)**.

## MVP Requirements

- An array to hold services requested, which is updated dynamically as services are added
- Buttons to add services to the array
- A dynamic DOM element to display the array and update as the array changes
- Prevent charging more than once for the same service
- Update total costs dynamically
- Button to "send invoice", which serves to reset the array and display elements

## Stretch Goal Completed

- I added a 'remove' feature for each item in the array. Clicking 'remove' on an item removes it from the array and updates the DOM.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
